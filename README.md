# swag-tag

swag-tag is an old-fashioned custom element designed to demo and edit other web components.

It requires that the web component exposes a json definition file for the web component, following the format [generated by this tool](https://github.com/runem/web-component-analyzer).

## Syntax

<swag-tag-mwc href=../mwc-textfield-example1.json tag=mwc-textfield-example1></swag-tag-mwc>

## [Demo](https://jsfiddle.net/bahrus/mdysp1ab/1/)
